## 🎯 Project Overview

ArUco markers are binary square fiducial markers used for camera pose estimation. This repository provides a structured approach to implementing these markers in various environments:

* **2D Processing:** Marker generation, dictionary selection, and robust identification in image streams.
* **3D Applications:** Camera calibration, PnP (Perspective-n-Point) algorithms, and real-time pose estimation ($X, Y, Z$ and rotations).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* **Python 3.x**
* **OpenCV contrib** (required for ArUco modules):
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-contrib-python numpy
  ```
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

````bash
git clone [https://github.com/CarlosM1024/ArUco.git](https://github.com/CarlosM1024/ArUco.git)
cd ArUco
````

2. Camera Calibration (For 3D): Before using the 3D scripts, ensure you calibrate your camera using the scripts in 3D/calibration/ to obtain your camera_matrix and dist_coeffs.


## 🛠️ Usage

### 2D Detection
Navigate to the 2D folder and run the detection script:

````Bash
python 2D/detect_markers.py
````

### 3D Pose Estimation
To visualize the 3D axis on a detected marker:

````Bash
python 3D/pose_estimation.py
````
